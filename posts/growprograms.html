            <p>This post was inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1465556099667566600">tweet</a> from Omar Rizwan:</p>
            <q>i want to grow a program, like it's a plant that lives down in my browser console, and i take care of it and add to it over days and months and years</q>
            <p>I love this metaphor of "growing programs" and wanted to explore what that might look and feel like. The following is story about Alice, an avid user of a fictional notes app, and her experience growing programs within in, starting from their inception as manual workflows all the way of up to spinning off into stand-alone applications.</p>

          <p>
            Alice's work involves a lot of writing, so much of her day is spent inside her favourite notes app.
          </p>
          <p>
            As she goes about her work day to day, she organically develops particular ways of doing things within the app which fits the way she thinks and works. A few example workflows:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    She keeps a "rough notes" document which she uses to squirrel away snippets of text, new ideas, and tangential thoughts. It's her default place to put text as she goes about her day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every time she starts a new essay, she adds the date she started it at the top and a date she expects to finish it. She also adds a "change log" section, which she uses to jot down what she added or changed in the essay each day and a "todos" section where she keeps a small list of the next steps for the essay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
