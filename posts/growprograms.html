          i want to grow a program, like it's a plant that lives down in my
          browser console, and i take care of it and add to it over days and
          months and years

          I love this metaphor and want to explore what it might look and feel
          like to play it out. What follows is a story about Alice, an avid user
          of a fictional notes app, and her experience growing programs within
          it.

        <h2>Manual workflows are the seeds of programs</h2>
        <p>
          Alice's work involves a lot of writing, so much of her day is spent
          inside her favourite notes app.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she goes about her work, she organically develops workflows which
          fit the way she thinks and works. For example:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            She keeps an "Inbox" section at the start of each essay where she
            keeps a list of next steps, unincorporated ideas, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            She keeps an "Archive" section at the bottom of each essay, where
            she keeps sentences and paragraphs that she needed to cut but wants
            to keep around to maybe bring back in.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These workflows are the seeds of programs. They're well-defined and
          repeatable, something something that could be implemented by a
          computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          But workflows like these may drastically change as you find ways to
          improve them or as the needs of your work changes. Since they're quick
          and easy to implement, Alice doesn't mind implementing them manually
          and find doing so provides lots of opportunities to notice how they
          can be improved.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Scripts are the initial sprouting of a program</h2>
        <p>
          As time goes on, some of her workflows become core parts of her work.
          Especially the archiving workflow, which she uses many times a day.
          Although she likes having an archive of her cut sentences, she doesn't
          like how implementing it takes her out of the flow of writing. Every
          time she wants to archive some text, she needs to select it, cut it,
          scroll all the way to the bottom of the document, paste it under the
          archive heading, and then scroll back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would love it if she could just select some text, hit a hotkey,
          and have it moved down to the archive automatically. Luckily, the
          notes app supports end-user scripting, so she decides to try creating
          one for this workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice has some experience programming, but never in this environment,
          so she decides to use the apps macro recorder to get started. She
          clicks "start recording macro", manually performs the steps in her
          archive workflow, and then clicks "stop recording macro". This creates
          a new script which performs exactly the actions she just did manually.
          The resulting script isn't perfect, but it only takes a few
          modifications in the apps built-in IDE to get it working how she
          wants.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, her first program has sprouted! She assigns it to a hot key
          and gets back to your work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The script requires a bit of tending to as she uses it - fixing a bug
          here, adding some logic there - but this is easy to do within the app.
          When there's an error, the app provides a notification, and with one
          click she's dropped into a debug mode to fix it. As she tends to it,
          there's no need to recompile or redeploy. The program is always
          running live right there in the app and ready to go.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Some scripts bloom into packages</h2>
        <p>
          Over the coming weeks, Alice implements more and more of her workflows
          as short scripts. None of them are very intricate, but they save her
          time throughout the day and allow her to focus on the writing itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point she notices that some of the scripts feel like
          variations on the same idea. All of them take a piece of text, and
          then quickly moving it to another section or document. The notes app
          supports creating packages as well, so she decides to try refactoring
          these scripts into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          She creates abstractions which span the specific use cases which her
          scripts implement, and encapsulates them in modules. She also defines
          the main interface for the package: some built in defaults like "move
          to archive", and "move to inbox", as well as an option to search and
          select any section and document to move to. She surfaces the interface
          through the right-click menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as she uses the package, it feels just right. It took some time
          and tending to for her scripts to grow, but they've now bloomed into
          the program that they always wanted to be.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Programs can outgrow their home and must be repotted</h2>
      <p>
        Eventually Alice's scripts and packages begin to settle. Her writing
        environment fits the way she thinks and works more than it ever has, but
        she's still not satisfied. It feels like there's more room to improve,
        but her programs seem to have hit a plateau.
      </p>
      <p>
        There comes a time in every plants life when a change in it's living
        accommodations is required, and itâ€™s time for a repotting. This could be
        because it's outgrown its previous container or because it simply needs
        some new soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice knew that her programs could be so much more if allowed to grow,
        but they were hitting the limits imposed by their home inside the notes
        app.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she decided it's time to build them a new home. She exports her
        programs from the notes app and places them into a new folder. She fires
        up her code editor and gets to work building a stand-alone app which can
        grow unconstrained to fit her writing needs perfectly.
