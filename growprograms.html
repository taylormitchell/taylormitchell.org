          i want to grow a program, like it's a plant that lives down in my
          browser console, and i take care of it and add to it over days and
          months and years
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I love this metaphor and want to explore what it might look and feel
          like to play it out. What follows is a story about Alice, an avid user
          of a fictional notes app, and her experience growing programs within
          it.
        </p>

        <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
        <p>
          Alice's work involves a lot of writing, so much of her day is spent
          inside her favourite notes app.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she goes about her work, she organically develops workflows which
          fit the way she thinks and works.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, she keeps an "Inbox" section at the start of each essay
          where she puts next steps, new ideas, etc and an "Archive" section at
          the bottom, where she keeps sentences and paragraphs that she needs to
          cut but can't bring herself to delete.
        </p>
        <p>
          By having a consistent structure for her essays (Inbox and Archive
          sections) and methods for handling certain types of text (e.g. todos
          and cut sentences), Alice is creating fertile soil for programs to
          grow within.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Seeds</h2>
        <p>
          As time goes on, some of her workflows become core parts of her work.
          Especially the archiving workflow, which she uses many times a day.
          Although she likes having an archive of her cut sentences, she doesn't
          like how implementing it takes her out of the flow of writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would love it if she could just select some text, hit a hotkey,
          and have it moved down to the archive automatically. Luckily, the
          notes app supports end-user scripting, so she decides to try creating
          one for this workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice has some experience programming, but never in this environment,
          so she decides to use the apps
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_recorder"
            >macro recorder</a
          >
          to record her performing the archive workflow and create a script
          which mimics it. The result isn't perfect, but it only takes a few
          modifications in the apps built-in IDE to get it working.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, the seed of a program is planted! She assigns it to a hot
          key and gets back to your work.
        </p>

        <h2>Sowing</h2>
        <p>
          Over the coming weeks, Alice creates a bunch of short scripts. None of
          them are very intricate, but they save her time throughout the day and
          allow her to focus on the writing itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the scripts she never ends up using, while other's take root.
          This stage feels like sowing the seeds. You can't count on any one
          seed to sprout so you need to plant lots.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Tending</h2>
        <p>
          The scripts require a bit of tending to as she use them - fixing a bug
          here, adding some logic there - but this is easy to do within the app.
          The script lives right there in the app with you, so it's always right
          within reach to make changes to. There's no need to compile or deploy,
          the script is running live in the app so changes are reflected
          instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When there's an error, the app provides a notification. With one,
          you're dropped into a debug mode which allows you to step through an
          find the problem.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Blooming</h2>
        <p>
          At some point, Alice notices that some of the scripts feel like
          variations of the same idea. All of them take a piece of text, and
          then quickly moving it to another section or document. The notes app
          supports creating packages, so she decides to try refactoring these
          scripts into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          She creates abstractions which span the specific use cases which her
          scripts implement, and encapsulates them in modules. She also defines
          the main interface for the package: some built in defaults like "move
          to archive", and "move to inbox", as well as an option to search and
          select any section and document to move to. She surfaces the interface
          through the right-click menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as she uses the package, it feels just right. It took some time
          and tending to for her scripts to grow, but they've now bloomed into
          the program that they always wanted to be.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Repotting</h2>
      <p>
        Eventually Alice's scripts and packages begin to settle. Her writing
        environment fits the way she thinks and works more than it ever has, but
        she's still not satisfied. It feels like there's more room to improve,
        but her programs seem to have hit a plateau.
      </p>
      <p>
        There comes a time in every plants life when a change in it's living
        accommodations is required, and itâ€™s time for a repotting. This could be
        because it's outgrown its previous container or because it simply needs
        some new soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice knew that her programs could be so much more if allowed to grow,
        but they were hitting the limits imposed by their home inside the notes
        app.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she decided it's time to repot them. She exports her programs from
        the notes app and places them into a new folder. She fires up her code
        editor and gets to work building a new stand-alone notes app which can
        grow unconstrained to fit her writing needs perfectly.
