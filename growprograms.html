          i want to grow a program, like it's a plant that lives down in my
          browser console, and i take care of it and add to it over days and
          months and years
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I love this metaphor and wanted to explore what it might look and feel
          like to play it out. What follows is a story about Alice, an avid user
          of a fictional writing app, and her experience growing programs within
          it.
        </p>

        <h2>Fertilizing</h2>
        <p>
          Alice's work involves a lot of writing, so much of her day is spent
          inside her favorite writing app.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she goes about her work, she organically develops workflows which
          fit the way she thinks and works.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, she keeps an "Inbox" section at the start of each essay
          where she puts next steps, new ideas, and misc prose. She also keeps
          an "Archive" section at the bottom, where she moves sentences and
          paragraphs that she needs to cut but can't bring herself to delete.
        </p>
        <p>
          This consistent structure in her essays (Inbox and Archive sections)
          and methods for handling certain types of text (new ideas and cut
          sentences), relieves some of the pressure of writing . She doesn't
          need to worry about where to put her nuggets of inspiration or agonize
          over cutting a sentence forever. She has a consistent system she can
          use to reliably handle these cases so she can focus her energy on
          writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not only that. Programs thrive in environments with structure, so
          by adding some structure to her writing, she's also fertilizing the
          app for programs to grow.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Sowing</h2>
        <p>
          As time goes on, some of her workflows become core parts of her work.
          Especially the archiving workflow, which she uses many times a day.
          Although she likes having an archive of her cut sentences, she doesn't
          like how implementing it takes her out of the flow of writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would love it if she could just select some text, hit a hotkey,
          and have it moved down to the archive section automatically. Luckily,
          the writing app supports end-user scripting, so she decides to try
          creating one for this workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice has some experience programming, but never in this environment,
          so she decides to use the app's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_recorder"
            >macro recorder</a
          >
          to create the initial script. The result isn't perfect, but it only
          takes a few modifications in the app's built-in IDE to get it working.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, the seed of a program is planted! She assigns it to a hot
          key and gets back to your work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the coming weeks, Alice creates many more scripts like this. None
          of them are very intricate, but they save her time throughout the day
          and allow her to focus on the writing itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the scripts die off, while other's take root. This stage feels
          like sowing seeds. You can't count on any one seed to sprout so you
          need to plant lots.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Growing</h2>
        <p>
          The scripts require a bit of caring for - fixing a bug here, adding
          some logic there - but this is easy to do. The script's home is inside
          the app alongside her, so it's always right within reach. When there's
          an error, she gets a notification, and with one click she's dropped
          into a debug mode where she can step through and quickly track down
          the problem. Once fixed, there's no need to compile or deploy, the
          script is live within the app so changes are reflected immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, Alice notices that some of the scripts feel like
          variations of the same idea. All of them take a piece of text, and
          then quickly move it to another section or document. The writing app
          supports creating packages, so she decides to try refactoring these
          scripts into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          She creates abstractions which span the specific use cases which her
          scripts implement, and encapsulates them in modules. She also defines
          the main interface for the package: some default actions like "move to
          archive", and "move to inbox", as well as an option to search and
          select any section and document as a destination. Once finished, using 
          the package is as easy as selecting some text, right clicking, and then
          selecting an action from the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as she uses the package, she feels a shift. It took some time
          and care for her scripts to grow, but they finally feel like they've
          bloomed into the program that they were always meant to be.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Repotting</h2>
      <p>
        Eventually Alice's scripts and packages begin to settle. More than ever,
        her writing environment fits the way she thinks and works. But she's
        still not quite satisfied. It feels like there's more room to grow, but
        her programs have hit a plateau.
      </p>
      <p>
        There comes a time in every plants life when a change in it's living
        accommodations is required, and itâ€™s time for a repotting. Alice knew
        that her programs could be so much more if allowed to grow, but they
        were hitting the limits imposed by their home inside the writing app.
        For her programs to continue growing, they'll need a home of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        She'd sometimes thought about building a writing app herself, but the
        task had always felt too daunting. But now that her programs had grown
        this far, a stand-alone application felt within reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she exports her programs and places them into a new folder, fires up
        her code editor, and gets to work building a new home where her writing
        and programs can continue to grow unconstrained.
