	    	Hi! I'm a programmer and data scientist. Previously a mechanical engineer and competitive gymnast (I still do this one for fun). 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    At the moment, I spend a lot of my time playing with and thinking about tools for thought. I've been getting into <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> over the last few months and have been a long time user of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. I'm also building a tool called <a href="https://github.com/taylormitchell/ankify_roam">ankify-roam</a> which connects the two.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Tools like these are related to my general interest in knowledge, learning, and memory. Especially as they relate to making life better and solving problems. Both at a theoretical level (what is knowledge?) and practical level (how can I use these ideas to make life more awesome?). 
            </p>
