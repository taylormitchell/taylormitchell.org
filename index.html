	<h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
	    	Hi! I'm a programmer working in data analytics at IBM. Previously a mechanical engineer and national gymnast. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Some of my current interests include: tools for thought (especially related to memory), critical rationalism, and progress (and how to make it). 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Born and raise in Toronto, Canada.
	    </p>

	<h2>What I'm doing right now</h2>
	<div>
	    <p>
	    I've been playing with and really enjoying a writing tool called <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>. Using Roam has stirred up a lot of ideas around tools for thought, writing practices, and thinking environments. That's led to building some experimental tools and practices within Roam which I may share on here in the future. One such tool is <a href="https://github.com/taylormitchell/ankify_roam">ankify-roam</a> which allows you to define flashcards inline as you write and then easily sync them to the Anki.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    I'm trying to build and write in public. Even though I've read countless people advocating to do so and I agreed with all their reasons, I've always had trouble getting over the emotional discomfortable with the idea. This website, ankify_roam, and my slightly-above-lurking level of engagement on twitter are my first steps in that direction.
